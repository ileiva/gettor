1) Clone into the latest version of gettor:

$ git clone https://github.com/ileiva/gettor.git

2) Get the PGP key that signs the Tor Browser Bundle

2) Visit https://console.developers.google.com//start/api?id=drive&credential=client_key and follow OAUTH2 process to get client ID and client secret for 'other' desktop application.

3) Edit drive.cfg to with new client-id and secret. Leave refresh_token empty.

4) Install the google drive API python client:

$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client 

5) Run the script:

$ python bundles2drive.py

The first time the script is run, you will have to authorize it through a web browser. You will be prompted with a URL. Once that is done, a refresh token will be stored locally so that re-authorzing is unnesaccary.

The script will then look for files in upload_dir (as specified in drive.cfg) and upload them to google drive. If no errors occur, it will then add formatted links and hash information to the drive.links file.
